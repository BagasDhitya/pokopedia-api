# ðŸ›’ Pokopedia API

The backend for the **Pokopedia** daily groceries application is built with **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Prisma** as the ORM, connected to either **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** as the database engine.
This project is designed with a **class-based architecture**, ensuring that every part of the application is modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. Each layer has its own clear responsibility â€” from database access and business logic, to request handling and routing. The codebase is organized into well-structured folders, making it straightforward for developers to navigate and extend new features.

The folder structure is as follows:

```
src/
 â”£ config/
 â”£ dto/
 â”£ services/
 â”£ controllers/
 â”£ routers/
 â”£ helpers/
 â”— app.ts
```
